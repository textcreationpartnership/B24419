            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Huy and Cry AFTER CONSCIENCE.</head>
            <p>FIRST, to describe Her, if I speak by guess only, and by the discourse of most: She is God knows what, an <hi>Individuum va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum;</hi> no one that I have consulted can lay claim to her justly; she's like <hi>UTOPIA,</hi> pretended to by many, but such gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally as intend to do nothing for her, but discourse; she's like an old Woman, whom few men value, but at the grave, or in some business wherein they may gain by her; she's thought to be a long Cloak, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly worn for Formalities sake by <hi>John Presbyter;</hi> and thus is she abused. But not to weary my self or the Reader; according to common discourse and mistaken Opinion, she is not to be describ'd (having been so long absent) but by her Effects, and those are so strange and contrary, that she works upon every disposition according to it's temper; and thus mistaken for <hi>Religious Humour,</hi> that bastard Child of Religion dipt by the name of <hi>NON-CONFORMITY,</hi> her Zeal hath often imbrew'd the whole World in Bloud, and like a Fury praecipitated men of all sorts to the most desperate and unreasonable things. Rebellion hath often had it's being from her, and seldom is able to move without her countenance; and as she enrages some, she allayes the fury of others, and makes them patient and calm under the greatest injuries and oppressions: she is blind, and if well guided, of excellent use to the sillier sort, but for want of due management, like <hi>Phaeton</hi>'s Chariot, she destroyes all before her. Now we have such a distracted account as most men give of her, let us consider what really she is: If I understand her, she was originally called <hi>INNO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CENCE</hi> in <hi>Paradise,</hi> and when <hi>circumcis'd</hi> by the <hi>Jews, INTEGRITY;</hi> which terme not pleasing the <hi>Church,</hi> she was Baptized <hi>GOOD-CONSCIENCE:</hi> so much for her Name. Her Originals are, <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, Truth, Fidelity</hi> and <hi>Charity.</hi> She is a perfect satisfaction to a mans self, of having done no hurt, nor suffering any to be done, when it was in her power to prevent it; nor wilfully omitted any good which she had an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to do. Now you have her <hi>positive,</hi> let's know her <hi>negative</hi> defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition. She's no Truce-breaker, Rebel, or Traytor, nor can she converse
<pb facs="tcp:187022:2"/>with them, but to their Ruine, which she brings them at last, being their perfect Enemy. In fine, she leaves all such as are wilfully guilty of any disloyal, unjust, or ungrateful Action: upon these terms I fear there be few that have been lately acquainted with her. She's an eternal Friend to those who enjoy her, and leaves no man, who hath her, in the greatest straits; she is very resolute, and is not to be perswaded to any thing contrary to Truth for the greatest benefit; she's plain, and values no Riches but that of the Mind, and therefore seldom enriches her Proselytes, and that's the reason she hath so few, and lies so obscure.</p>
            <p>So many (unable to make a right use of her, or such as only abuse her name to draw on their wicked designs, to cheat, undermine and abuse such as deal with them) have falsly laid claim to her; and so few made any right use of her, that she hath long since forsaken the publique, and is wandred into some obscure place, where she may find an innocent Retreat from the Abuses of the Age.</p>
            <p>But that we may recover her once again, let us consider where she is, or as <hi>Scoggin</hi> un-til'd the house to find a Hare, let us first examine where she is not.</p>
            <p>She was never in <hi>France</hi> since they denyed our King his Tribute. She was never in <hi>Holland</hi> since the <hi>English</hi> (their too kind Protectors) were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd their Cautionary Towns; and for want of her, both <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> run on to more Wickedness and Ingratitude, to ripen their mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous over-grown Sinnes.</p>
            <p>She's no Courtier, for three reasons; she goes very plain, hath found no Protection for many years, and is an Enemy to Dissimulation.</p>
            <p>She's no Citizen, for she hath verily long since been banished Shops and Ware-houses, as an Enemy to Trade; though in her absence her name is boldly abused in all Cheating bargains.</p>
            <p>The Church is so much defil'd by the Impurity of the late times, and smells so rank of the Abuses of these, she seldom comes thither; and she is never summoned to the <hi>Spiritual Court,</hi> because she hath no Money to pay Officers Fees.</p>
            <p>She's no Lawyer, for she takes no Fees, (though she Pleads much;) and seldom appears in Chancery, but <hi>in forma Pauperis;</hi> and then she finds small encouragement from the Clarks.</p>
            <p>Now to guess where she is, let us consider her Condition.</p>
            <p>She's like an honest old Cavalier, she hath spent all in doing good, and finding her self sleighted at last, is retreated into some obscure place in the Countrey to hide her shame, and mitigate, by absence, her sorrow for the Ingratitude of the Age.</p>
            <p>If any man can find her out, and perswade her to come to publique Conversation again, she may be a great Blessing to the World, and he cannot want a correspondent Reward.</p>
